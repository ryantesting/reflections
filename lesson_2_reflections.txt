Q: What happens when you initialize a repository? 
Why do you need to do it?

It creates an empty repository. You need to do
it, otherwise there will be no repository for
your commits 

Q: How is the staging area different from the 
working directory and the repository? What value 
do you think it offers?

It is a tentative commit that can have files
added or removed, whereas a repository is 
a collection of all commits. It allows a user
to make changes before actually going forward
with a commit
